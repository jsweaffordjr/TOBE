# TOBE

These MATLAB scripts and Simulink models were developed to control an 18-DOF robot built from
the BIOLOID Type-A kit, using Dynamixel AX-12+ motors. The read_write2.m script is a modification
of the read_write script supplied by ROBOTIS, and allows the user to control two motors, instead of
one. That script was the basis for the TOBEjointctrl.m script, which allows for the control of all 18
motors manually.
